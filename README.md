Where Weather and Dog Care Wag Together

## Features
- Real time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API
- Background color that changes based on weather
- Weather based product suggestions for dog owners
- Safety tips based off temperature
- Color coded messages that recommend whether it's comfortable for a walk or if it's better to stay inside and play

## Why I Built This

I wanted to build something useful not just for myself, but for other dog owners who need quick, weather based guidance for daily care.

## Future Plans
- Push notifications and alerts: Notify users of weather chagnes that may impact their dog's safet oor outdoor activities.
- Interactive maps: Show dog parks, and walking trails.
